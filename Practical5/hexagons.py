#In this range n<6 calculate the first five
#h represents the total number
#then calculate the representation of h
#Get the first five results
n=1
#calculte the the first five results
while n<6:
        h = 2*n*(2*n-1)/2
#calculate the formula and get results
        print(h)
#It can always be calculated
