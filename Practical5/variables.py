#Calculate the difference inabc using the formula and compare the magnitude
#We know which is farther away aftercomparing the difference represented by d and e
#Get result
#abc represent distance between different places
#abs express absolute value
a=-3.19
b=-118.24
c=116.39
#d and e represent the distance 
d=abs(a-b)
e=abs(a-c)
#compare d and e then output results
if d<e:

#compare W and Z if ture
#Get result
#Logical comparison of W and Z Ture or False
#X represents Ture,Y represents False
X=True
Y=False
#W represents x and y,Z represents x or y 
W="X" and "Y"
Z="X" or "Y"
#Get result
