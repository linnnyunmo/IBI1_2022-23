GO:0000045	autophagosome assembly	The formation of a double membrane-bounded structure, the autophagosome, that occurs when a specialized membrane sac, called the isolation membrane, starts to enclose a portion of the cytoplasm.	0
GO:0000421	autophagosome membrane	The lipid bilayer surrounding an autophagosome, a double-membrane-bounded vesicle in which endogenous cellular material is sequestered.	1
GO:0016236	macroautophagy	The major inducible pathway for the general turnover of cytoplasmic constituents in eukaryotic cells, it is also responsible for the degradation of active cytoplasmic enzymes and organelles during nutrient starvation. Macroautophagy involves the formation of double-membrane-bounded autophagosomes which enclose the cytoplasmic constituent targeted for degradation in a membrane-bounded structure.  Autophagosomes then fuse with a lysosome (or vacuole) releasing single-membrane-bounded autophagic bodies that are then degraded within the lysosome (or vacuole). Some types of macroautophagy, e.g. pexophagy, mitophagy, involve selective targeting of the targets to be degraded.	10
GO:0016237	lysosomal microautophagy	The transfer of cytosolic components into the lysosomal compartment by direct invagination of the lysosomal membrane without prior sequestration into an autophagosome. The engulfing membranes fuse, resulting in the lysosomal delivery of the cargo wrapped in a single membrane derived from the invaginated lysosomal membrane. In S. cerevisiae, the vacuole is the lysosomal compartment.	3
GO:0016240	autophagosome membrane docking	The initial attachment of an autophagosome membrane to a target membrane, mediated by proteins protruding from the membrane of the vesicle and the target membrane. Docking requires only that the two membranes come close enough for these proteins to interact and adhere.	0
GO:0016243	regulation of autophagosome size	Any process that modulates the size of the autophagosome.	2
GO:0030399	autophagosome membrane disassembly	The controlled breakdown of the membranes of autophagosomes.	0
GO:0032258	protein localization by the Cvt pathway	A cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway that uses machinery common with autophagy. The Cvt vesicle is formed when the receptor protein, Atg19, binds to the complexes of the target protein (aminopeptidase or alpha-mannosidase homododecamers), forming the Cvt complex. Atg11 binds to Atg9 and transports the Cvt complex to the pre-autophagosome (PAS). The phagophore membrane expands around the Cvt complex (excluding bulk cytoplasm) forming the Cvt vesicle. This pathway is mostly observed in yeast.	0
GO:0034423	autophagosome lumen	The volume enclosed within the autophagosome double-membrane.	0
GO:0044753	amphisome	Intermediate organelles formed during macroautophagy through the fusion between autophagosomes and endosomes.	0
GO:0044754	autolysosome	A type of secondary lysosome in which a primary lysosome has fused with the outer membrane of an autophagosome. It is involved in the second step of autophagy in which it degrades contents with acidic lysosomal hydrolases.	0
GO:0045771	negative regulation of autophagosome size	Any process that reduces autophagosome size.	0
GO:0045772	positive regulation of autophagosome size	Any process that increases autophagosome size.	0
GO:0048102	autophagic cell death	A form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagic cell death is characterized by lack of chromatin condensation and massive vacuolization of the cytoplasm, with little or no uptake by phagocytic cells.	1
GO:0061709	reticulophagy	The autophagic process in which parts of the endoplasmic reticulum are loaded into autophagosomes, delivered to the vacuole, and degraded in response to changing cellular conditions.	0
GO:0061739	protein lipidation involved in autophagosome assembly	The protein lipidation process by which phosphatidylethanolamine is conjugated to a protein of the ATG8 family, leading to membrane insertion of the protein as a step in autophagosome assembly.	0
GO:0061753	substrate localization to autophagosome	The localization process by which an autophagic substrate is delivered to a forming autophagosome.	0
GO:0061906	autophagosome localization	Any process in which an autophagosome is transported to, and/or maintained in, a specific location within the cell.	0
GO:0061908	phagophore	A disk-like structure that expands, rounds up into a cup-shaped structure, and eventually closes around its cargo (for example cytoplasmic components) to become an autophagosome or Cvt vesicle.	0
GO:0061909	autophagosome-lysosome fusion	The process in which autophagosomes, double-membraned vesicles containing cytoplasmic material, fuse with a vacuole (yeast) or lysosome (e.g. mammals and insects). In the case of yeast, inner membrane-bounded structures (autophagic bodies) appear in the vacuole. Fusion provides an acidic environment and digestive function to the interior of the autophagosome.	0
GO:0061910	autophagosome-endosome fusion	The process in which an autophagosome fuses with an endosome to create an intermediate autophagic organelle called amphisome.	0
GO:0097635	extrinsic component of autophagosome membrane	The component of the autophagosome membrane consisting of gene products and protein complexes that are loosely bound to one of its surfaces, but not integrated into the hydrophobic region.	0
